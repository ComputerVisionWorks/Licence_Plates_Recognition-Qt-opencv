# Qt-Licence-Plates-Recognition
I can upload files again after nearly 11 months due to the unstable network.

This program started in 11/10/2016 and finished in 02/14/2017. I translated it from Matlab script to C++ with Opencv 3.2, it could work in my test but still have some bugs that can lead to terrible crash. But I don't want to fix it by now because it was my first program with UI and it reads badly. I think if I want to recode it, I will write a class and use struct.

Ahhhhhhhh, my English is also bad.
