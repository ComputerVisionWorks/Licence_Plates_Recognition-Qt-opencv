# Qt-Licence-Plates-Recognition
I can upload files again after nearly 11 months due to the unstable network.

This program started in 11/10/2016 and finished in 02/14/2017. I translated it from Matlab script to C++ with Opencv 3.2, it could work in my test but still have some bugs that can lead to terrible crash. But I don't want to fix it by now because it was my first program with UI and it reads badly. I think if I want to recode it, I will write a class and use struct.
Ahhhhhhhh, my English is also bad.

用C艹重写Matlab车牌识别，用了Qt库写界面，opencv库处理图像。因为是第一次写，所以写的很粗糙，不过好歹翻译成c艹了，还能用，只不过在某些情况下会崩溃，我现在也懒得再改了，如果要改的话，那就重写好了。再重写我一定要写成类的形式，那个时候还没有接触到类
